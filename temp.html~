<p class="rtejustify"><strong><a href="http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/vacci.html">Computer-Aided Vaccine Design </a>:</strong> There are millions premature deaths every year as well as economic burden on developing world, due to infectious diseases. Fortunately, we have effective vaccines against number of dread diseases (e.g. small pox, polio) that save millions of deaths every year. Traditionally whole pathogens in killed form are used as vaccine that is costly and toxic. In modern era major emphasis is on designing of subunit vaccine based on epitope/peptide, which are cheaper and less toxic. Raghavaâ€™s group is working in the field of immunoinformatics from last 12 years in order to understand the immune system with help of computer. Group have developed more than 25 web-servers for predicting immune response against a peptide this include simulation of adaptiveand innate immune system. These servers may be classified in following categories.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Exogenous Antigen Processing (Adaptive Immunity) :</strong> The antigen presenting cells of immune system uptake exogenous antigens/proteins, degrade these proteins into small peptides. Selective peptide bound to MHC class II molecules that present them to T-helper cells. The T-helper cell release specific class of interleukins/cytokines based on nature of a peptide. Group developed following major servers for predicting immune response of a given peptide based on its amino acids sequence; I) Propred: Prediction of promiscuous binders for 51 MHC class II alleles using virtual matrices; ii) HLADR4pred: Prediction of HLA-DR4 binder using a highly accurate method, iii) IL4pred: Designing and disovering of interleukin-4 inducing peptides and iv) IFnepitope: Designing of interferon-gamma inducing epitopes.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Endogenous Antigen Presentation (CTL Epitopes) :</strong> In case pathogen is inside a infected cell then antigens released by pathogen is processed using following pathway; i) antigen cleaved in peptides using proteasomes, ii) TAP binding peptides enter into ER, iii) selective peptides inside ER bind to MHC class I molecules, iv) MHC bound peptide presented on cell surface, v) CTL recognize MHC bound peptides and release cytokines to kill infected cells. His group developed web servers for predicting charterstics of peptide to identify best vaccine candidate based on whole endogenous antigen pathway. Following is list of major servers developed by his group; I) Propred1: Prediction of promiscuous binders for 47 MHC class I alleles using virtual matrices; ii) nHLApred: Highly accurate prediction method for 67 MHC class I alleles; iii) MMBpred: Searching a potential vaccine candidate by introducing mutations at selected positions in the antigenic sequence, iv) Pcleavage: Identification of proteasome cleavage sites in a protein sequence, v) TAPpred: prediction of T-cell epitopes and vi) CTLpred: Discrimination between the MHC binder T-cell epitopes and the MHC binder non-epitopes.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Innate Immunity and B-Cell Epitopes :</strong> First time his group uses machine learning techniques for predicting linear B-cell epitopes and increase accuracy from 58 to 67%. Recently a highly accurate method has been developed for predicting linear B-cell epitope on experimentally validated B-cell epitopes and non-epitopes. CBtope is first method developed for predicting conformational B-cell epitopes from amino acid sequence of antigen. Recently a database of â€œpattern-recognition receptors and their ligandsâ€<9d> has been build called PRRDB that provides comprehensive information about innate immunity. This database will be very useful in designing effective adjuvant for subunit vaccine and in understanding role of innate immunity.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong><a href="http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pepdesi.html">BioDrugs (In silico Designing of Therapeutic Peptides) </a>:</strong> Traditionally small molecules are used as drug; in recent years number of approved drugs based on small molecules is decreasing. Therapeutic peptides are possible alternative to traditional drugs based on small chemical compounds. Despite their tremendous importance in the field of biology and medicine, so far limited efforts has been made in the field of peptide bioinformatics. Raghava's group developed numerous computational tools for designing therapeutic peptides.

<p class="rtejustify"><strong><a href="http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/genannot.html">Annotation of Genomes/Proteomes </a>:</strong> Presently thousands of organisms have been sequenced and databases maintain whole genome sequencing is growing with exponential rate. This has posed a major challenge for bioinformaticians to annotate these genomes for predicting the genes and the repeat regions. The protein sequence databases are also growing exponentially due to progress in sequence techniques. The major problem is functional annotation, as most of the proteins obtained from the genomes do not provide any information about the function of protein. Group is developing in-silico methods for annotating genomes and proteomes. In case of genome annotation, group have developed tools for predicting i) protein coding region in prokaryotic genomes using Fast Fourier Transformation, ii) similarity aided ab Initio method for predicting location and structure of genes in eukaryote genomes, iii) identification of spectral repeats using FFT and iv) genome-wide similarity search using BLAST and FASTA. It is difficult to predict function of a protein directly, thus group developed methods for predicting important class of proteins and proteins reside in specific location of a cell.
